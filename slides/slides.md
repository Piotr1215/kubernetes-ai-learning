# Enhancing Verification with Artificial Intelligence

---


## Problem Statement

- 🤖 AI faces issues with consistency and reliability when dealing with large YAML files.
- 🧠 AIs can have "hallucinations," generating illogical outputs that become more problematic as the input size increases.
- 📈 This inconsistency makes working with AI models non-deterministic and error
  prone

---

## Goals

- 💪 Enhancing AI chatbot reliability
- 🔬 Using OpenAI's latest model with function calling
- 📚 Utilizing document retrieval systems as knowledge base
- 🧠 Connect everything into one cohesive pattern

---

## Implementation

- 💼 Implementing the draft using Flowise
- 🛠️ Creating an API using Python Flask
- 💻 Communicating with a local Kind cluster that has Crossplane installed.
- 💬 Embedding a chatbot on a web page.

---

## Closing Thoughts

- 💭 Debate between model fine-tuning and chain of reasoning
- 🚀 Potential use cases:
  - 🤖 dedicated chatbots per customer
  - 📈 help increase crossplane adoption
  - 🌐 virtual platform engineer
- 📚 Needs more research and resources
